# AI Facies Classification End-to-End Application

This repository contains the source code for an AI-powered facies classification web application. The app leverages deep learning models (ResNet34, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 - as backbones) to analyze input images and classify geological facies such as Upper North Sea, Middle North Sea, Lower North Sea, Rijnland/Chalk, Scruff, and Zechstein (using the [Dutch F3 Dataset](https://github.com/yalaudah/facies_classification_benchmark/tree/main)). The application uses Flask for the web interface and FastAPI to provide a RESTful API.

## Contributors
This project wouldn't have been possible without the hard work and dedication of me and my amazing colleague, Mazen Sakr. I want to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude to him.

## Overview

### Web Interface & API
- A user-friendly web interface lets users upload images and view classification results.
- An API endpoint (`/api/predict`) provides predictions along with confidence scores.

### Lazy Model Loading
- Models are loaded asynchronously in the background on the first request, reducing initial startup times.

### Containerized Deployment
- The app is fully containerized using Docker.
- The Dockerfile is designed to work with Git LFS for managing large model weights and supports deployments on platforms such as Koyeb and Railway.

### Health Check Endpoint
- A dedicated `/health` endpoint is provided to verify that the application is running correctly.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Models:** Uses three models (UNet34, UNet50, and UNetInception) to classify facies.
- **Flexible API:** Users can choose the model via a form parameter (default: `resnet50`).
- **Robust Deployment:** Dockerfile configured for multiple deployment environments with Git LFS integration for large model weights.
- **Lazy Loading:** Improves application startup by loading models in a background thread.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Git (with [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) installed)
- Docker (for containerized deployment)

### Local Setup

#### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oashraff/ai-facies-classification.git
cd ai-facies-classification
```

#### Install Dependencies

Create and activate a virtual environment, then install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Pull Git LFS Files

Ensure Git LFS is installed and run:

```bash
git lfs pull
```

#### Run the Application

```bash
flask run
```

The app will be accessible at [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000).

## Docker Deployment

### Building the Docker Image

#### Ensure the `.dockerignore` File

To allow Git LFS to work, remove any exclusions for `.git` and `.pth` files from your `.dockerignore`

#### Build the Image

```bash
docker build -t ai-facies-classification .
```

#### Run the Container Locally

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 ai-facies-classification
```

## API Documentation

**Endpoint:** `/api/predict`  
**Method:** `POST`

**Parameters:**
- **image** (file): The image to classify.
- **model** (form field, optional): Model to use (`resnet50`, `resnet34`, or `inceptionv3`). Default is `resnet50`.

**Response Example:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "prediction": {
    "Upper North Sea": 20.5,
    "Middle North Sea": 30.2,
    "Lower North Sea": 15.0,
    "Rijnland/Chalk": 10.0,
    "Scruff": 12.3,
    "Zechstein": 12.0
  },
  "confidence": 0.87
}
```
